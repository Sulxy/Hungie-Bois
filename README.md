Hungie Bois project
This website was designed with your hunger in mind! It uses your current location and your preferred choice of restaurant (Dine-In, Drive-Through, Sit Down, Carryout) and provides you with a curated selection that is presented to you 1-by-1! Why think when you can Yass or Pass?

Uses OpenWeather API, and Google Places API to populate tiles.

Presents user with a curated selection of restaurants within 15 miles of their location.
Also has a Gimme Whatever! option that will present the user with a truly random selection to choose from.
Displays current weather conditions in an easy to read format.
